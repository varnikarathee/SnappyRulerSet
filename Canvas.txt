In CanvasScreen.kt:
- Implement a full-screen Box with a Compose Canvas inside.
- Add gesture handling:
  - One-finger drag = freehand drawing (store points continuously).
  - Two-finger pinch = zoom.
  - Two-finger drag = pan.
- Store strokes in CanvasState as Shape.PolyStroke(points).
- Render strokes on the canvas using Path.
- Add a light gray background grid:
  - Grid spacing = 5mm (convert using device dpi).
  - Cache the grid drawing into an offscreen Bitmap for performance.
